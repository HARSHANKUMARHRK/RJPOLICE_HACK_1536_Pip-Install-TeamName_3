# AI-Powered Police Assistance System

## Overview
This project provides an AI-driven solution for police departments to automate and enhance the process of detecting theft and other anomalies. By leveraging advanced deep learning algorithms and MediaPipe action simulations, this system helps in identifying complex actions and semantics associated with theft. The solution includes a robust dashboard for tracking cases, metrics, and hotspots, and offers several innovative features to aid law enforcement.

## Project Description

### Key Features

1. **Automated Theft Detection**
   - Utilizes deep learning models to analyze complex actions and detect theft or anomalies.
   - MediaPipe action simulations to understand and predict suspicious activities.

2. **Dashboard for Police Monitoring**
   - Comprehensive dashboard to keep track of ongoing cases, metrics, and hotspots.
   - Real-time notifications via email or other communication methods when users enter designated hotspots.

3. **Surveillance Camera Protection**
   - Detects any attempt to displace overhead surveillance cameras.
   - Captures and sends high-resolution images using image denoising techniques (RIDNet and RCNN) to enhance quality.

4. **Evidence AI**
   - Uses descriptions provided by victims to automatically draw and generate features of suspects.
   - Assists police in tracking criminals based on detailed descriptions.

5. **Prompt Assistance**
   - Allows users to get immediate assistance from the police department through an interactive prompt system.

6. **Automatic FIR System**
   - Automatically generates and files FIRs based on the criminal's activities, ensuring adherence to government ethics and guidelines.
   - Prevents the filing of fake cases by validating the authenticity of the reported activities.

### Methodology

#### 1. Deep Learning for Theft Detection
- **Algorithms Used**: Various deep learning models are employed to recognize and analyze complex actions indicative of theft.
- **MediaPipe**: Action simulations are implemented to model and predict human actions in surveillance footage.

#### 2. Dashboard Functionality
- **Case Tracking**: Monitor and manage cases with real-time updates and metrics.
- **Hotspot Monitoring**: Identify and track hotspots, notifying users when they enter these areas to prevent crime.

#### 3. Surveillance Camera Protection
- **Displacement Detection**: Identify attempts to tamper with or move surveillance cameras.
- **Image Enhancement**: Use RIDNet and RCNN for image denoising and resolution enhancement to ensure clear and actionable evidence.

#### 4. Evidence AI
- **Suspect Feature Generation**: Automatically generate visual features of suspects based on victim descriptions, aiding in suspect identification and tracking.

#### 5. Automatic FIR System
- **Ethics and Guidelines**: Ensure all FIRs follow governmental ethics and guidelines.
- **Validation**: Validate activities to prevent false reporting and ensure genuine cases are filed.

### Applications
- **Law Enforcement**: Enhance police efficiency in detecting and preventing theft.
- **Public Safety**: Improve overall public safety by proactively monitoring and responding to suspicious activities.
- **Criminal Investigation**: Aid in criminal investigations by providing accurate and automated suspect descriptions and evidence.

### Future Work
- **Enhanced Detection Algorithms**: Continuously improve deep learning models for more accurate detection.
- **Integration with Other Systems**: Expand integration capabilities with other law enforcement and public safety systems.
- **User Interface Improvements**: Enhance the dashboard and user interface for better usability and accessibility.
